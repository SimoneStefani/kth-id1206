# Operating Systems (ID1206)
The course provides knowledge of the principles of how one can implement abstractions of hardware and virtualisation of resources and scheduling of tasks.
The structure of an operating system is studied to increase the knowledge of these concepts and also give skills in efficient use of the abstraction level that an operating system offers.
